                    Creative commons is a nonprofit dedicated to strengthening the
                    "thriving commons of shared knowledge". CC offers
                    licenses and a variety of other legal tools to help the public
                    effectively share their work to others. Their licenses are easy to
                    understand and completely free-to-use. (Creative Commons)

                <p>
                    Above are the 5 creative commons licenses, including the creative commons
                    logo. They are (in order from left to right) BY, SA, NC, ND, and CC0 or
                    public domain. BY enables others to remix, distribute, etc. with your work,
                    as long as they give proper attribution. SA means that if you distribute the
                    work, it must be under identical terms as the original. NC means that people
                    who distribute your work can't monetize it. ND is the most restrictive, meaning
                    that users can't edit your work at all. Lastly CC0 is an official public domain
                    certification from creative commons. You can combine these terms to make 
                    specific licenses, like BY-SA, BY-NC-ND, etc. If you know you need a CC license
                    but don't know exactly which one, try out the "License Selector" at the top of
                    this website. (Creative Commons)

                <p>
                    Outside of creative commons there are other licenses, most notably
                    the "All Rights Reserved" term. As you might believe, tihs copyright term
                    is used to denote that the creator has control over all distribution and
                    modification of their work. These kinds of copyright usually have you pay
                    a fee to the government copyright office (in the United States, the U.S. Copyright Office)
                    in order to properly register your ownership of a work.
